Hi,
sounds good. I haven't gotten access to the SVN repository yet, so I attached the code to this mail. Run 'experiment_nonlinapprox' to estimate a DP model from synthetic data from pole-cart (x sampled uniformly over a hypercube in the state-space). In the folder invped, there are some files to generate more realistic data from a simulation, but I haven't used this for inference yet. If you have some problem running it, just let me know.

Fredrik
